    "### **Step1:** Define the Problem\n",
    "You need to learn enough about the problem to select the framing or framings of the prediction task. (is is classification or regression or some other problem?)\n",
    "Maybe you need to talk to stakeholders and share summary statistics and data visualizations.\n",
    " \n",
    "### **Step2:** Prepare Data\n",
    "transforming the raw data into a form that can be used in modeling involves the addition, deletion, or transformation of training set data\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step3:** Evaluate Models\n",
    "evaluate ml models requires that you design a robust test harness so that your results can be trusted and used to select among the models.\n",
    "You must select a metric for evaluating the skill of a model to establish a baseline (floor) in performance. Also you must choose how to resample a split your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick and dirty or large data evaluations you can single split into train/test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often K-fold cross validation is a common data resampling technique \n",
    "\n",
    "You will also perform hyperparameter tuning and ensembles of models.\n",

    "### **Step4:** Finalize Model\n",
    "Select the final model that represents the solution to the problem.\n",
    "Evaluate the hold out validations set.\n",
    "Summarize the data for stakeholders.\n",
    "Prepare the model for production such as integrating it into software.\n",
    "Set up performance maintnenance and monitoring."
